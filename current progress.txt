1. Reading data from a file

1	C	0
2	W
3	A	1	2
4	O	1	3
5	C	1
6	X	4	5
7	N	6

W = Wire with variable state
C = constant with known state
A = And gate
O = Or gate
X = Xor gate
N = Not gate

make sure there's no loops

2. Multi-step process (Repeat until nothing changes
a) Simplify individual gates (change to a not or eliminate)
b) Simplify pairs of gates

3. Write to new file
a) Display how many gates were removed
b) How many constant wires
c) How many total wires
